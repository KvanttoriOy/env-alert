# Env Alert

You know the feeling when you debug a problem for hours, and then you realize you forgot to update your `.env` file when pulling the latest changes? I know that feeling all too well ðŸ™‚ This extension aims to prevent such mistakes.

The extension simply compares your project's `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.development` and `.env.production` file's structure to your `.env.example` file, and tells you if you are missing any keys, and if there are any unnecessary keys.

**Happy debugging!**
